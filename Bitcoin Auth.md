Bitcoin Mining Software: You will need Bitcoin mining software, such as cgminer or bfgminer.

Python Environment: Ensure that Python is installed, and you have the necessary libraries (subprocess, hashlib, etc.).

Security Access Token: This should be securely generated and stored.

The script will:

Monitor a specific file for access attempts.

Check if the access is authorized using a security token.

If unauthorized access is detected, it will trigger the Bitcoin mining process.

Security Access Token: The SECURITY_ACCESS_TOKEN is predefined and should be stored securely. It represents the authorized token needed to access the file.

Access Token Validation: The check_access_token function compares the provided token against the secure token to validate access.

Bitcoin Mining Process: The start_bitcoin_mining function triggers the Bitcoin mining process using the mining software installed on your system. The subprocess.run command is used to start the mining process.

File Monitoring: The monitor_file_access function continuously monitors the specified file. If the access token provided does not match the secure token, it triggers the mining process.

Adjusting for Real Deployment: Replace /path/to/bitcoin/mining/software with the actual path to your Bitcoin mining software and the appropriate arguments.
