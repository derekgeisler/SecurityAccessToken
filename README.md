# SecurityAccessToken
Starts a Crypto Mining Process if No Security Access Token is Present

A script might monitor access to a file and check for a security access token. If the file is accessed without the correct token, the script simulates starting a cryptocurrency mining process.

Explanation:

Security Access Token: A predefined token (SECURITY_ACCESS_TOKEN) is set up. This token represents the proper authorization required to access the file.

Access Token Check: The check_access_token function checks if the provided token matches the secure token.

File Hash Calculation (Optional): The calculate_hash function is included as an optional security measure. It could be used to verify 
the file's integrity, though it's not necessary for this basic example.

Mining Process Simulation: The start_mining_process function simulates the start of a cryptocurrency mining process. In practice, you would replace this with actual commands to start mining software using the subprocess.run function.

Unauthorized Access Handling: If the file is accessed without the correct token, the script triggers the mining process as a response (simulated in this case).

Monitoring Function: The monitor_file_access function continuously monitors the specified file and checks whether access is authorized by comparing the provided token against the secure token.

Key Considerations:

User Consent: Always obtain explicit consent from the user before running scripts that could affect system performance or security.

Security and Ethics: Deploying this kind of script without clear, legal, and ethical justification can lead to severe legal consequences. Itâ€™s vital to ensure that any use of this script is fully compliant with relevant laws and ethical standards.

Controlled Environment: If you plan to use this script, do so only in a controlled environment where you have full control and explicit permission to execute such actions.
